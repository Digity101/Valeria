            <p>Fuzzy Search is the default search from the main page. You can identify it by the fuzzy search icon being on.</p>
            <img src="Guide_files/Fuzzy.png">
            <p>Fuzzy Search allows you to search the monsters by name 
and number if you already know what you are looking for and just want to
 get to its card page.</p>
            <p>In addition, Fuzzy also supports certain prefixes to 
narrow down further such as colour, rarity, certain collabs/seasonals, 
and some common abbreviations/nicknames such as “revo” for 
“reincarnated”.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Advanced search is accessed by clicking the Fuzzy Search icon to toggle it off.</p>

            <p>The page itself is labeled for instructions of use. 
Advanced allows you to more specifically refine your search to consider 
many parts of a card, including its stats, awakenings, and active/leader
 skills. A small number of skills are still in progress for more 
specific searches, but the majority allow for further narrowing. 
Advanced search can be used to find cards that fit your needs more 
exactly, for example, finding blue dragons with FUA and 7c awakenings 
(including Super Awakenings), or finding inheritable actives that unlock
 the board and do a full board change including light but contains at 
most 3 colours and not taking longer than 10 turns.</p>

            <p>While fairly straightforward, there are certain areas that are clickable.</p>
            <img src="Guide_files/Card1.png">
            <p>Favouriting will keep a card pinned so you can compare 
cards side by side if you navigate to another page. If your screen 
resolution is not high enough, however, they will display vertically 
instead.</p>
            <img src="Guide_files/Favourites.png">
            <p>Clicking on any awakening from this screen will take you 
to a page showing cards with the awakening, organized by count. It 
accounts for super awakenings in its own headings to easily 
differentiate which ones are only usable in solo mode. Clicking a voice 
awakening, however, will instead play the card’s NA region voice clip.</p>
            <img src="Guide_files/Awakenings.png">
            <p>Both these areas are clickable and have useful functions.</p>

            <p>The evolution tree displays a customizable tree of 
materials needed to make the card. You can manually click each node to 
expand it to its own evo mats. Collapsing what you already own and 
expanding what you do not can exactly create your own tree.</p>
            <img src="Guide_files/EvoTree.png">
            <p>A summary of the displayed tree is located at the bottom of the page.</p>
